 2.3 One-Way Functions:
 - One-way functions are essential for protcols to work
 - A simple metaphor for one-way functions is like breaking a plate - it's easy to break but hard to put back together
 - Trapdoor one-way function is a special one-way function that has a "secret door" - if you know where the secret door is it's easy to compute the function to the other direction
 - An example of a trapdoor one-way function is like taking apart a watch, it's hard but with the secret - metaphor for the instructions - it's easy.

 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions:
 - A one-way hash function is for example, a fingerprint
 - It takes a variable-length input string pre-image and converts it to a fixed-length output string hash value
 - A one-way hash function is a hash function that works in one direction, meaning it's easy to compute from a pre-image but hard to generate a pre-image that hashes to a particular value
 - A good one-way hash function is also collision-free
 - Collision-free means that it is hard to generate two pre-images with the same hash value
 - An example: if you want to verify that someone has the same file as you but don't want them to directly send it to you, so you ask them for the hash value, this way you can be mostly certain if they have the same file
 - A message authentication code (MAC) is a one-way hash function with the addition of a secret key

### Install Hashcat
- First did sudo apt-get update
- Then sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget
