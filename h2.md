# Summary of article's chapters 'Abstract' and '3.2 Kill Chain':
- Kill chain is a systematic process targeting adversary to create the desired effects.
- Methdos like kill chain are very important since it helps people address vulnerabilities and recognize threaths.
- APT:s are well structured adversaries that conduct campaigns that target economic, proprietary and natural security information.
- The definitions of different kill chain phases are explained:
    - Recoinnaissance: including research, identification and selection of the targets, often seen as going through email lists, Internet websites or information on specific technologies.
    - Weaponization: coupling a remote access trojan with an exploit into deliverable payload.
    - Delivery: delivery of the weapon to the planned environment.
    - Exploitation: after the weapon has been delivered exploitation triggers the intruder's code. Often exploitation focuses on an application or operating system vulnerability.

#  a) Tactics, tools and procedures
Define tactic and give an example of a specific tactic:
- Tactics represent and answer to the "why" of the ATT&CK technique. It defines the reason for performing an action. One example of a tactic is the lateral movement, it's one of the 14 enterprise tactics. Lateral movement means that the adversary is trying to move through your environment. 
Define technique and subtechnique, and give an example of each:
- Techniques represent the "how" of how the adversary achieves it's goal by performing an action. An example of a technique is Sudo and Sudo caching, this means that adversaries may perform sudo caching and use it to elevate privileges. Adversaries do this to spawn processes with higher privileges.
- Subtechniques are a detailed desription of the adversarial behavior used to achieve a goal. For example an adversary can dump credentials by accessing the Local Security Authority secrets.
Define procedure, and give an example of each:
- Procedures are an implementation that the adversary uses for techniques and subtechniques. For example, a procedure is when an adversary dumps credentials by scraping LSASS memory of a victim.
